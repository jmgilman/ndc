# Design Document

Nix Dev Container (NDC) is a [development container][1] aimed at containerizing
development environments using a [Nix flake-based][2] design.

## Goals

1. Allow Nix-based development flows to be available for developers who may not
   have Nix installed locally.

2. Provide rich customization options via an integrated flake library.

3. Easily integrate into existing flake-based designs.

### Non-Goals

1. NDC is not a generalized container that can be used outside Visual Studo
   Code.

2. NDC does not target non-Nix based development workflows.

3. Customizing NDC is secondary to it's primarily opioniated design.
